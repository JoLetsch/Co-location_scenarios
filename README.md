# OWF shapefiles
We compiled publicly accessible data source of OWF polygons (table X1). We created an OWF-present shapefile with all polygons from OSPAR and Emodnet that indicated operational OWFs or those under construction. Both Emodnet and OSPAR offer OWF polygons for the entire North Sea region, but lack certain areas especially when it comes to future OWFs, which is why we added OWFs from national marine spatial plans. For the OWF-future scenario, we merged all gathered data sources including planned OWFs and development sites of which some may only be used between 2030 and 2040. Therefore the OWF-future scenario represents an extreme case.
